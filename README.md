View all Bug Herd Tasks at once.


All you need to do is upload this script to your website and plug in your API key.

Due to BugHerd's API they require a 3 second delay between API calls.
I added PHP sleep(3); to put a 3 second delay between calls.

Depending on the size of projects you have it may load slow.

Good luck!
