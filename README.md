View all BugHerd Tasks at once.


All you need to do is upload this script to your website and plug in your API key.

Due to BugHerd's API they require a 3 second delay between API calls. :-1:

I added PHP sleep(3); to put a 3 second delay between calls.

Depending on the size of projects you have it may load slow.

Good luck!
